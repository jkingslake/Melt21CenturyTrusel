## To run this in a pangeo binder

### The best option is to use this link to run a binder environment built for this repo

Click this button:
[![Binder](https://staging.binder.pangeo.io/badge_logo.svg)](https://staging.binder.pangeo.io/v2/gh/jkingslake/Melt21CenturyTrusel.git/master)

Advantage: you dont need to install anything else, as all the packages are already installed. 
 

#### an alternative, second option: use pangeo's default binder

https://binder.pangeo.io/v2/gh/pangeo-gallery/default-binder/master/?urlpath=git-pull?repo=https://github.com/jkingslake/Melt21CenturyTrusel%26amp%3Burlpath=lab/tree/Melt21CenturyTrusel


Disadvantage: you need to open a terminal in the binder and install nc-time-axis with `conda install nc-time-axis`
