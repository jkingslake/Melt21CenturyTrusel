# Melt21CenturyTrusel


Simple notebook for loading, plotting and eventually analyzing Antarctic melt projection from Trusel et al. https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2563/

## options for opening in a pangeo binder to run the notebook remotely

### first option: use binder environment built for this repo

Click this button:
[![Binder](https://staging.binder.pangeo.io/badge_logo.svg)](https://staging.binder.pangeo.io/v2/gh/jkingslake/Melt21CenturyTrusel.git/master)

Advantage is that you dont need to install anything else, as all the packages are already installed. 

Disadvantage is that is take a while to load (~5 mins). 

### second option: use pangeo's default binder

https://binder.pangeo.io/v2/gh/pangeo-gallery/default-binder/master/?urlpath=git-pull?repo=https://github.com/jkingslake/Melt21CenturyTrusel%26amp%3Burlpath=lab/tree/Melt21CenturyTrusel

Advantage: boots up much faster

Disadvantage: you need to open a terminal in the binder and install nc-time-axis with `nc-time-axis`
